Hi Stephen,

I’m Alessio, part of the IBM team working on Suncorp on Master Data Management (MDM) – which is already actively being used within your organization! Importantly, this investment is at no cost to you, as SunCorp has already implemented and paid for our MDM solutions. I’m focused on exploring how we can expand the value and reach of these powerful tools.

Master Data Management delivers a single source of truth for customer data, enhancing Customer 360°, improving data quality, streamlining operations and ensuring seamless integration. We'd like to discuss how we can further leverage this tool across your wider business – potentially expanding its usage within key areas. I’ve attached a case study – would you be open to a quick chat?

Best regards,
Alessio
